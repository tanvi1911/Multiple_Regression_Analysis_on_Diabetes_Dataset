## Introduction

In this notebook, we explore the application of multiple regression in predicting diabetes progression based on various medical features. Multiple regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the Diabetes dataset, which contains information about diabetes progression and medical features such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, and more. The goal is to build a multiple regression model that can predict diabetes progression based on these features.

## Notebook Contents

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: We start by loading the dataset and exploring its structure, content, and statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Multiple Regression Modeling**: We apply multiple regression to create a predictive model for diabetes progression.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using various regression evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2) Score.

5. **Feature Importance**: We analyze the importance of individual features in predicting diabetes progression.

## Dependencies

This notebook uses Python and several libraries, including:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)

You can install these dependencies using `pip` if they are not already installed.
